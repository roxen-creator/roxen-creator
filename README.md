### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Roxen a developer by day and a code ninja by night. 
Welcome to my GitHub bio! Here's a glimpse into my world of creativity, design, and development.

About me: I'm a passionate technologist with a keen eye for aesthetics and a love for all things design and development. My journey began with graphic designing, where I discovered the power of visual communication and its impact on user experience. From there, I delved into the realms of UI/UX designing, mobile app development, front-end development, and web design. With each new project, I strive to create intuitive and visually captivating experiences that engage and delight users. 

I'm intrested in Front-End Web Development | UI/UX Designing.
